The dynamo examples in the directories below the one containing this
README use the Dynamo 0.1 API. They are primarily provided to
illustrate the use of the PSyclone code-generation system. 

In order to use PSyclone you must first add it to your PYTHONPATH:
::
    export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/PSyclone/src:${PYTHONPATH}

PSyclone can be run for each of the examples by entering the directory and 
executing, e.g.
::
    python ./runme.py

Examine the runme*.py scripts themselves for further details.
