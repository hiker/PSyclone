        1) #263 OpenMP (including colouring) supported for the 0.3 Dynamo
	API. Parser fails gracefully if Kernel-code parsing is
	unsuccessful.

	2) #292 Add support for user-supplied transformations/optimisations
	via a script passed to the generate function/command-line. This
	enables the use of transformations within a build system.

	3) #292 Documentation for Algorithm, PSy and Kernel layers as well
	as for transformations has been added. Documentation on using
	transformation scripts then added on top.

	4) #292 Dynamo example scripts fixed.

        5) #258 First version of kernel-stub generator added. Given kernel
        metadata as input, PSyclone has enough information to be able to
        generate stub kernel code with the appropriate arguments and 
        argument ordering.
	
        6) #364 OpenMP fix for update 1) (ticket #263). 'ncolour' variable
        now declared. New dynamo/eg3 example added to demonstrate the use
        of transformation scripts introduced in update 2) (ticket #292).

release 1.0.2

	1) #299 temporary boundary condition
	support. matrix_vector_kernel_mm now uses enforce_bc_code rather
	than enforce_boundary_w2 as the latter is no longer used.

release 1.0.1

	1) #299 temporary boundary condition support. removed the
	hardwired code and associated test that added an additional
	boundary condition array to ru_kernel as this kernel is no longer
	required. Added support for generating a boundary condition array
	in the PSy layer and passing it into the enforce_bc_kernel
	kernel. enforce_bc_kernel should be placed by the algorithm
	developer to enforce boundary conditions.

release 1.0.0
