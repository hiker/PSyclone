        1) #263 OpenMP (including colouring) supported for the 0.3 Dynamo
	API. Parser fails gracefully if Kernel-code parsing is
	unsuccessful.

release 1.0.2

	1) #299 temporary boundary condition
	support. matrix_vector_kernel_mm now uses enforce_bc_code rather
	than enforce_boundary_w2 as the latter is no longer used.

release 1.0.1

	1) #299 temporary boundary condition support. removed the
	hardwired code and associated test that added an additional
	boundary condition array to ru_kernel as this kernel is no longer
	required. Added support for generating a boundary condition array
	in the PSy layer and passing it into the enforce_bc_kernel
	kernel. enforce_bc_kernel should be placed by the algorithm
	developer to enforce boundary conditions.

release 1.0.0
