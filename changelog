	1) #263 OpenMP (including colouring) supported for the 0.3 Dynamo
	API. Parser fails gracefully if Kernel-code parsing is
	unsuccessful.

	2) #292 Add support for user-supplied transformations/optimisations
	via a script passed to the generate function/command-line. This
	enables the use of transformations within a build system.

	3) #292 Documentation for Algorithm, PSy and Kernel layers as well
	as for transformations has been added. Documentation on using
	transformation scripts then added on top.

	4) #292 Dynamo example scripts fixed.

	5) #258 First version of kernel-stub generator added. Given kernel
	metadata as input, PSyclone has enough information to be able to
	generate stub kernel code with the appropriate arguments and
	argument ordering.

	6) #364 OpenMP fix for update 1) (ticket #263). 'ncolour' variable
	now declared. New dynamo/eg3 example added to demonstrate the use
	of transformation scripts introduced in update 2) (ticket #292).

	7) #361 Minor updates to the kernel-stub generator. Remove spurious
	dir() command, remove additional '_code' from kernel subroutine name
	and add 'implicit none' to the generated subroutine.

	8) #363 Update to the generator script to catch any run-time
	errors generated by the user-supplied optimisation script. Such
	errors are then reported in a user-friendly fashion to aid
	debugging.

	9) #272 Added support for explicit loop bounds in the PSy layer
	for the GOcean1.0 API. The Cray compiler makes use of this
	information to generate more efficient code. This option can be
	switched on or off using a transformation.

        10) Support the module in-lining of kernel subroutines. i.e.
        kernel subroutines can be moved into the same module that contains
        the invoke from which they are called. This functionality is
        implemented as a new transformation, 'KernelModuleInlineTrans'.
        psyGen.py has also been made fully pep8 compliant.

        11) #347 Add an option to limit the length of lines of fortran
        code that PSyclone generates to 132 chars. This is the length
        mandated by the Fortran free-format standard and is rigorously
        enforced by some compilers (e.g. PGI). As a part of this change
        PSyclone now checks the length of all lines of source code in
	the Algorithm and Kernel files that it parses.

release 1.0.2

	1) #299 temporary boundary condition
	support. matrix_vector_kernel_mm now uses enforce_bc_code rather
	than enforce_boundary_w2 as the latter is no longer used.

release 1.0.1

	1) #299 temporary boundary condition support. removed the
	hardwired code and associated test that added an additional
	boundary condition array to ru_kernel as this kernel is no longer
	required. Added support for generating a boundary condition array
	in the PSy layer and passing it into the enforce_bc_kernel
	kernel. enforce_bc_kernel should be placed by the algorithm
	developer to enforce boundary conditions.

release 1.0.0
